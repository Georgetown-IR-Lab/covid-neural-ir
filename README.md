# SLEDGE: A Simple Yet Effective Baseline for Coronavirus Scientific Knowledge Search

Below are the steps to reproduce the primary results from Sean MacAvaney, Arman Cohan, and Nazli Goharian. 2020. SLEDGE: A Simple Yet Effective Baseline for  Coronavirus Scientific Knowledge Search. arXiv. [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.02365.pdf)

SLEDGE topped the [TREC-COVID leaderboard](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1NOu3ZVNar_amKwFzD4tGLz3ff2yRulL3Tbg_PzUSR_U/edit#gid=1068033221) in Round 1 of TREC-COVID.

The code to reproduce the paper is incorporated into [OpenNIR](https://github.com/Georgetown-IR-Lab/OpenNIR).
Refer to https://opennir.net/ go get started.

Note: Despite our best efforts to control for differences, results may vary based on hardware configurations and other seemingly random conditions. Using a Quadro RTX 8000, we were able to get within 0.02 nDCG@10 and within 0.01 P@5 / P@5 (rel2) of our submitted runs (97% judged@5 rate).

## Step 1 of 1: Train and Evaluate SLEDGE

Training and validation on MS-MARCO (domain transfer setting):

```bash
$ scripts/pipeline.sh config/sledge
# (will prompt to download MS-MARCO data the first time -- it takes some time to download, process, index, etc.)
[snip]
valid epoch=50 map=0.2843 [mrr@10=0.2933] ndcg@20=0.3296 p@1=0.2097 rprec=0.2056
```

When you're ready to evaluate on the COVID-19 collection, provide `pipeline.test=True`:

```bash
$ scripts/pipeline.sh config/sledge pipeline.test=True
# (will prompt to download CORD-19 and TREC-COVID data the first time -- may take ~40 minutes for downloading, processing, indexing, etc.)
[snip]
test  epoch=50 judged@5=0.9667 ndcg@10=0.6661 p@5=0.7800 p_rel-2@5=0.6467
```

If you want to use for round 2, configure your system by:

 - setting `test_ds.date=2020-05-01` to use the May 1, 2020 release of CORD-19
 - setting `test_ds.subset=rnd2-query`, `test_ds.subset=rnd2-quest`, `test_ds.subset=rnd2-narr` use the queries, questions, narratives for Round 2 topics.
 - resetting `test_ds.bs_override=`

If you want to train on the medical-related subset of MS-MARCO, configure your system by:

 - setting `train_ds.subset=train_med`

## Med-MARCO

The medical subset of MS-MARCO was constructed by filtering queries that have terms found in [MedSyn](http://ir.cs.georgetown.edu/downloads/ECIR2013-ADRTrace.pdf), a lexicon of layman and expert medical terminology. The full list of MS-MARCO training IDs that match the filter are found [here](https://github.com/Georgetown-IR-Lab/covid-neural-ir/blob/master/med-msmarco-train.txt).

Note that we removed some terms frequently yielded false matches from MedSyn (e.g., gas).

## Trained Models

If you'd rather not train the models yourself:

| File | Description | MD5 | Link |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| `sledge.p` (513MB) | SLEDGE model trained on MS-MARCO | `3195b81e380a8efb5df1dd9aafdcb12b` | [Google Drive][sledge.p]  |
| `sledge-med.p` (513MB) | SLEDGE model trained on medical subset of MS-MARCO | `0660bf152f05e75356b78bc2eb6e7b82` | [Google Drive][sledge-med.p]  |

## FAQ

**I want to test this on my own queries!**

OpenNIR is designed for experiments with standard benchmarks. But it's possible (albeit a little hacky) to add additional queries.

Just make a new file `~/data/onir/datasets/covid/myqueries.tsv`. Ths TSV file contains the text of the queries in the where each line is the following format: `{qid}\t{qtype}\t{qtext}` -- where `{qid}` is the query ID, `{qtype}` is the type of the query -- e.g., `query` (keyword query), `quest` (question), `narr` (narrative), or whatever you like, really -- and `{qtext}` is is the textual content of the query. You'll also need a dummy standard TREC qrels file: `~/data/onir/datasets/covid/myqueries.qrels`. This needs to exist and have at least one record in it, but it can be a dummy record like: `1 0 docid 0`. (Note that if you use a dummy file here, the evaluation OpenNIR provides about the run is useless.)

Then, to instruct OpenNIR to use your custom queries, use `test_ds.subset=myqueries-query` -- where `myqueries` is the name of the file and `query` is the `{qtype}`. If you want to use the same queries for initial retrieval and re-ranking, you'll need to set `test_ds.bs_override=`.
